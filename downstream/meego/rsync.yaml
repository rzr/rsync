Description: |
    Rsync uses a reliable algorithm to bring remote and host files into
    sync very quickly. Rsync is fast because it just sends the differences
    in the files over the network instead of sending the complete
    files. Rsync is often used as a very powerful mirroring process or
    just as a more capable replacement for the rcp command. A technical
    report which describes the rsync algorithm is included in this
    package.
